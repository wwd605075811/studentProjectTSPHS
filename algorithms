1. Greedy_TSPHS
   why greedy algorithm? A: The fastest way to get a high-quality solution

    1.1 Algorithmic Framework
        a. use greedy algorithm to get a TSP solution "P"
        b. Divide P into multiple trips by time limit [1]
        c. Optimize each trip to meet the time constraints and meet the minimum time consumption
        d. Combine trips into a tour

    1.2 conclusion
        After this algorithm, we can get a high quality TSPHS solution as a father.
2. Hotel_TSPHS
    why another algorithm? A: Genetic algorithms require at least two parents as the primary population.

    After the greedy algorithm, we can get an optimal number of hotels |H|.
    2.1 Algorithm Framework
        a. Randomly generate 5 hotel sequences of |H| + 1. [3]
        b. 5 sequences of |H| hotels are obtained by local segmentation. [2]
        c. For each trip, insert the customer in its category until the time limit is reached.
        d. The insertion order follows the dynamic programming algorithm [4] TODO
        e. After 10 TSPHS solutions are obtained, 2 optimal legal solutions are screened out

    2.2 conclusion
        After this algorithm, we have completed the population initialization of the genetic algorithm.
